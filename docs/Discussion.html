<p>In this dissertation a discussion was presented on nuclear data evaluation, history matching, and Gaussian process emulation. Methodology and results on three waves of history matching were then discussed. History matching iteratively reduces the plausible space of simulator inputs by comparing its outputs to experimental measurements while accounting for uncertainties. The analysis is made tractable by employing a Gaussian process model to emulate the relationship between the simulator inputs and outputs. The discussed methodology included choosing an appropriate set of design points at which to run the simulator, training and validating waves of emulators, using these emulators to identify non-implausible values for the input parameters, and sampling from the marginal posterior distributions of the active inputs conditional on subsets of the observed data.</p>
<p>The dissertation focussed on a particular case study examining nuclear reactions that take place when neutrons are incident upon the isotope Iron-56 at energies between 5 and 10 MeV. Experimental data on four reactions in this energy interval were extracted from EXFOR, a public database of nuclear reactions. The TALYS software was used to simulate nuclear data across the measured reactions and energies. A total of 28 TALYS parameters were examined across their ranges of possible values. No prior knowledge was employed to narrow the search space. After three waves of history matching, the non-implausible space was 0.03% of the volume of the original search space. The cost for this was approximately 1300 TALYS runs. Samples were then drawn from the marginal conditional posterior distributions of the parameters, using likelihoods functions for data on two of the observed reactions. The analysis showed that for many of the active parameters, a range of values were still consistent with the relevant data, which may indicate that more history matching waves would be required to reduce the plausible volume further, or that relevant outputs were insensitive to the settings for that parameter.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Limitations of the analysis<a href="Discussion.html#limits" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The intention of this dissertation was to demonstrate how Bayesian history matching could be used as a part of a nuclear data evaluation workflow. However, limitations in the analysis mean that the results themselves are only demonstrative and care should be taken in interpreting them too closely.</p>
<p>The main limitation of the analysis was the lack of availability of computational resources. Nuclear data evaluation is usually a high performance computing task, and this analysis was carried out on a personal laptop. Consequently, decisions on how long to run calculations for were made pragmatically. For example, in references <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jeremy_histmatch" role="doc-biblioref">Andrianakis et al. 2015</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bower2010galaxy" role="doc-biblioref">Bower, Goldstein, and Vernon 2010</a>)</span>, more simulator runs were carried out in successive waves to allow for higher order trend functions to be fitted. This was attempted in the second wave, where the time and opportunity arose to double the number of simulator from the first wave to 600. A trend function with first order and squared terms was fitted ( but not interaction terms as the number of interactions between 28 parameters was too large). However a great many of these models failed, indicating that more runs may have been needed in order to fit the more complex models, so a first order linear trend term was used instead. For the third wave, there was only resource to carry out 300 simulator runs for training the emulators.</p>
<p>A similar problem arose when evaluating proposal samples for the non-implausible space, as for each proposal sample, predictions had to be carried out for hundreds of models, and consequently, even computing implausibility measures for a few tens of thousands of proposal inputs required running calculations for a day or more. Issues such as these were non-trivial when making progress on analysis depended on the availability of results. Consequently some decisions were made that were not consistent with history matching in the literature, such as decreasing the number of training points used for the second wave, and not examining more complex trend functions.</p>
<p>One important consequence of not using enough training data to build emulators is that there are large regions of space in which the emulator must interpolate, and as discussed in Section <a href="GPR.html#covariance">4.5</a>, predictive uncertainty grows as the distance from the observed data. This can result in emulators being validated and proposal points being evaluated as non-implausible by virtue of a great amount of predictive uncertainty, as opposed to making a good match to results. Figure <a href="Discussion.html#fig:good-emulator">6.1</a> illustrates this point. The figure shows the results of the validation runs for the emulator of the (n,tot) reaction at energy 5.49 MeV for the third wave. The vertical lines show the two standard deviation predictive intervals for the emulator, and the reference line x=y is plotted. This emulator validated successfully. The emulator certainly captured the general trend of the simulator, but the good match can be seen to be in no small part due to the wide predictive intervals, the majority of which intersect the x=y line, indicating that the emulator predictions are within two standard deviations of the simulator outputs. As an illustration, the dashed lines indicate the emulator predictions that would not intersect the x=y line if the predictive standard deviation were reduced by a half. Although the two-sigma intervals intersecting the x=y line do not indicate that the emulator would be validated, it does help as a visual guide for how consistent the emulator is with the model outputs.</p>

<p>In Figure <a href="Discussion.html#fig:good-emulator">6.1</a>, the nominal measured cross section for this reaction at this energy is 3732 barns. This is certainly within the range of this plot, however it can be seen that the emulator predicts at cross sections two orders of magnitude greater than this, depending on the values of the active parameters. It was decided early on in the analysis that, when training emulators, the simulator outputs should not be scaled. This decision was taken as it was thought that an error could easily have been made when rescaling the emulator predictions to compute implausibility measures such as Equation <a href="History-Matching.html#eq:chi-sq-impl">(3.2)</a> and due to a lack of certainty in how the assumptions pertaining to the measures would hold up under rescaling. However, Figure <a href="Discussion.html#fig:good-emulator">6.1</a> proves good evidence that the simulator output would have benefited from logarithmic scaling to give the emulators a smaller predictive volume, and also to enforce non-negativity, which is a characteristic of cross-sections, and which can be seen to be violated in some of the predictions in the figure.</p>
<p>In <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jeremy_histmatch" role="doc-biblioref">Andrianakis et al. 2015</a>)</span> nine history matching waves are carried out over 18 active input parameters, and in <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bower2010galaxy" role="doc-biblioref">Bower, Goldstein, and Vernon 2010</a>)</span>, five history matching waves were carried out over 17 input parameters, using many thousands of simulator runs. In this dissertation, three history matching waves were carried out over 28 input parameters. Consequently, it is expected that further waves would refocus the input volume yet further and produce a more focussed non-implausible space.</p>
<p>In Section <a href="GPR.html#gp-software">4.8</a>, different Gaussian process software implementations were discussed, with the R package ‘DiceKriging’ being chosen because of its relatively quick run time and because it exposed a function that allowed access to predictive covariance matrices, an important component of model validation. However it is worth noting that <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gp_comparison" role="doc-biblioref">Erickson, Ankenman, and Sanchez 2018</a>)</span> found that ‘DiceKriging’ was one of the worst performers when tested against other Gaussian process software implementations. In particular, having to include a ‘nugget’ parameter (Section <a href="GPR.html#covariance">4.5</a>) to help the fitting procedure was unsatisfactory, but it was necessary in order to allow may of the parameter estimation routine to complete successfully.</p>
<p>It is expected that cross-sections at energies close together for the same reaction should be similar, and that an input parameter setting that gives good results for a given energy would also give good results for a neighbouring energy points. In this dissertation, independent emulators were built for every unique point, and no account was made for potential correlations of similar simulator outputs. This decision was taken because emulation of correlated multivariate outputs such as in <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-multivariate_gp" role="doc-biblioref">Fricker, Oakley, and Urban 2013</a>)</span> is a non-trivial extension to univariate emulation, and not easily implemented using out-of-the-box and well-known software implementations.</p>
<p>Finally, the values for observation uncertainties and simulator inadequacies used in this work were chosen arbitrarily, and this would be reflected in the results. More representative uncertainties could be obtained by better mastering the software described in <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Schnabel_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Schnabel et al. 2021</a>)</span> and through expert elicitation to better understand how far the simulator predictions should be expected to deviate from reality.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Further work and conclusions<a href="Discussion.html#further-work-and-conclusions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Identifying TALYS input parameter which give rise to good agreement with experiments is a step towards one of the endpoints of nuclear data evaluation, which is to have a set of cross-sections consistent with experimental data and with accompanying uncertainties. One way to achieve this with the results of history matching, is to run TALYS at many different values of the input parameters drawn from their joint posterior distribution. If a sufficient number of runs could be carried out, sample means and covariance matrices computed from the outputs of these runs could be used to define the evaluated dataset, one that would be consistent with experimental data and uncertainties, conditional on the modelling approach used. This task could also be made more efficient by using Gaussian process emulation in a similar way to that described in this work.</p>
<p>In conclusion, nuclear data evaluation is an enormous task and in this dissertation a small case study was examined to assess the usefulness of history matching as an addition to the evaluation tool-kit. The analysis showed some good results, with a large volume of parameter space able to be analysed with the help of Gaussian process emulation. It is expected that better results could be seen with better computational resources, by carefully defining relevant uncertainties, and by accounting for correlations between similar processes.</p>
